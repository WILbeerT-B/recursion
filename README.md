# recursion
Recursion is the idea that a function calls itself. It’s used to take a big problem and start breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces (“Divide and Conquer”) and continuing to feed their solutions back into the original function until some sort of answer is achieved and the whole chain unwinds.

We have two problems to practice recursion: Fibonacci and Merge Sort

For each problems, use iteration and recursion which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. 

Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
